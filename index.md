## **Research Experience**


### **Designing Control System for Ion Traps & Realizing Zeeman Scan and Rabi Scan of a Single Qubit**
>Mang Feng's Ion Trap Group, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics (WIPM) ,Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)  
March, 2019 -- Now

  Artiq is adopted by ion trap groups from NIST and Oxford University as the control system of ion traps. It integrates FPGA, AOM and DDS, and can control experimental processes through Python. Our group also adopted it for the operation of quantum information.  
  As the main developer of Artiq in our group, I designed functions that can implement zeeman scan and rabi scan for a single qubit and paluse shaping for DDS to Reduce AC-Stark effect. In addition, Based on scalability of Python, I made a custom GUI to facilitate the experimental process.
